## 1. Individual Depth

Depth stats for raw data were gathered from raw vcf files (e.g. A1.raw.vcf) generated from variant call scripts. 

Depth stats for filtered data is based on the dataset intersecting between museum and modern samples (isec). These are located in: SpeciesName/03_variants/filtered_variant_files_date/dir/

## 2. Individual missingness

Missingness stats for raw data from raw vcf files (e.g. A1.raw.vcf). These files need to be recoded to change missing variants to ".". 
```
bcftools filter -S . -O u -e 'FMT/DP=0' Species.raw.bcf |bcftools view -O b -o Species.raw.withmissing.bcf

vcftools --bcf Species.raw.withmissing.bcf --missing-indv
```


## 3. Expected heterozygosity
