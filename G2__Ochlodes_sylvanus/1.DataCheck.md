# Data Check

I'm getting really high numbers of SNP calls across all species - much higher than we got for Lymantria. I have to check whether this is a problem with the data or real variation. 


## tests

1. Depth across all loci

2. Nucleotide diversity

3. Heterozygosity


## Genetic variation

*Genetic variation calculated per individual and per population*

1. Nucleotide diversity in windows

2. Heterozygosity in windows
