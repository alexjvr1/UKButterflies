# Where all the data are stored at UoB 

Data are backed up in long term storage on the RDSF in two folders: 

/projects/Butterfly_genome_analysis

/projects/Adaptation_in_rainforest_flies

See below for a description of folders. 

## File organisation

#### 1. Raw data

All raw output from the sequencing facility will be kept as is in a folder and are named according to the library batch. 

e.g. Modern1, Museum1. 

#### 2. Reference genomes

Raw data for reference genomes have been kept as received - raw data is organised by species. 

Reference genomes for each species is stored in their respective species folders. 

#### 3. 20 species

Data for each species will be kept in a species folder ordered by triplet name (see shared google doc). 

Data within each folder will be organised as follows
