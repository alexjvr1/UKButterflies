# Analyses with ANGSD

## Background and questions

#### How does ANGSD deal with overlapping reads. 

Input for ANGSD is reads mapped with bwa mem.

## 1. Test the best Genotype Likelihood model to use

I will test this with G1, G2, and G3 following the example on [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Glcomparison)

Where 1=Samtools, 2=GATK (original model), 3=SOAPsnp, 4=SYK

ANGSD parallelises analyses, but not file reading (-P specifies the number of threads). See [here](https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd/issues/74) for comments on the issue. The most efficient solution is to split the regions file (-rf) - similar to the approach used to speed up variant calling with samtools/bcftools. 

I'll use the same regions files, but they need to be modified for ANGSD input. 

```
cp ~/G3_Hesperia_comma/03_variants/regions* ~/G3_Hesperia_comma/ANGSD/

for i in $(ls regions); do sed -i 's/,/\n/g' $i; done
```

For the initial tests I will use just a small subset of regions to minimise computing time. For G3 each regions file contains 5200 regions and the last file (regionsbe) contains 300. I'll split regionsbe into 3 files and run scripts in parallel. For the final script I'll run arrays of 100 regions in each job 

```
split -l 100 regionsbe regions100
```

And make three ANGSD input files
```
~/software/angsd/angsd -bam ~/G3_Hesperia_comma/mapped.modern.core.names -minInd 18 -minQ 20 -minMapQ 20 -uniqueOnly 1 -remove_bads 1 -only_proper_pairs 1 -GL 1 -doSaf 1 -out G3.GL1.test -rf regions100aa -anc ../RefGenome/Hesperia_comma

```
