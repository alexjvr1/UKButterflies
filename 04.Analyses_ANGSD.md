# Analyses with ANGSD

## 1. Test the best Genotype Likelihood model to use

I will test this with G1, G2, and G3 following the example on [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Glcomparison)

Where 1=Samtools, 2=GATK (original model), 3=SOAPsnp, 4=SYK

ANGSD parallelises analyses, but not file reading (-P specifies the number of threads). See [here](https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd/issues/74) for comments on the issue. The most efficient solution is to split the regions file (-rf) - similar to the approach used to speed up variant calling with samtools/bcftools. 

I'll use the same regions files, but they need to be modified for ANGSD input. 

```
cp ~/G3_Hesperia_comma/03_variants/regions* ~/G3_Hesperia_comma/ANGSD/

for i in $(ls regions); do sed -i 's/,/\n/g' $i; done
```

For the initial tests I will use just a small subset of regions to minimise computing time.
