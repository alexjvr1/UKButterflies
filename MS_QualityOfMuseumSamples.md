# MS: Museum sample quality 

We were interested to find out if museum sample quality was correlated with time of collection as different preservation methods were used at different time in the last century.

## Questions

1. Does DNA quality decrease directly with age? Ie. the longer it's stored the lower the DNA quality? 

2. Is DNA quality associated with a specific storage method? ie. poorer quality at a specific time rather than linearly with time. 

3. Is the amount of contamination (as determined by Blobtools) associated with the age or storage method of samples? 



#### Analyses: 

1. Nr of mapped reads vs age of sample

2. Percentage properly mapped reads vs age

3. Length of reads vs age of sample

4. Amount of deamination vs age of sample (MapDamage2)

5. Amount of contaminants (Blobtools)
