# MS: Museum sample quality 

We were interested to find out if museum sample quality was correlated with time of collection as different preservation methods were used at different time in the last century. 

Analyses: 

1. Nr of mapped reads vs age of sample

2. Length of reads vs age of sample

3. Amount of deamination vs age of sample (MapDamage2).
